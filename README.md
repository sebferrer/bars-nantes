## Proof Of Concept

## Project description


We realized that many bars were missing from other sources of information, and there was no way to find a recent, exhaustive database.
So we spent a while looking for sources that could complement each other to actually have all the bars in Nantes.
We would also need an adaptive script to cross sources (which will have different formats) while avoiding collisions.
We would like to add the possibility of checking bars already visited and some other cool features.
Everything must be automated and not require our intervention in the future.
